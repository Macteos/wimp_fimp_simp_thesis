# Dark Matter Production Mechanisms

This repository contains code and analysis for studying the production mechanisms of various dark matter candidates in the early Universe, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs), and Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs).

## Overview

The project focuses on investigating the evolution of the number density of dark matter relics for each of the three production mechanisms: WIMP, FIMP, and SIMP. This is achieved through numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation, as well as analytical approximations for the WIMP and SIMP cases.

The main objectives are:

1. **WIMP Production**: Numerically solve the Boltzmann equation and derive an analytical approximation for the number density of WIMP dark matter relics.
2. **FIMP Production**: Numerically solve the Boltzmann equation for the production of FIMP dark matter relics.
3. **SIMP Production**: Numerically solve the Boltzmann equation and derive an analytical approximation for the number density of SIMP dark matter relics.
